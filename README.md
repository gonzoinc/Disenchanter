# Disenchanter
Lightweight addon that displays the materials produced when armor or weapons are disenchanted within the items tooltip. 

Built to use the new mats system that is based off of the expansion the item was a part of not the old level system.

**_Only tested in retail version of WOW_**

## Dependencies

## Features

* Lists the materials available when disenchanting Armor and Weapons

## Known Issues
